## HackerRank
Trying to learn a little bit more about the linux shell. These are the solutions I coded in shell for all [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell) shell exercises.

Exercises are classified into:
- [Easy exercises](https://github.com/joisaac/hackerrank-shell/blob/main/easy-shell.sh)
- [Medium exercises]()
- Hard exercises
